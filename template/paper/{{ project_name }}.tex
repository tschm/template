\begin{abstract}
This paper provides a brief overview of the simple harmonic oscillator,
focusing on its mathematical description and physical significance. We discuss
the fundamental equation of motion and its solution, demonstrating why this
system serves as a cornerstone model in physics.

\section{Introduction}
The simple harmonic oscillator is one of the most fundamental models in physics.
Its applications range from the motion of pendulums to the behavior of atoms
in crystal lattices \citep{feynman1963}.

\section{Mathematical Description}
The equation of motion for a simple harmonic oscillator is given by:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + \omega^2x = 0
\end{equation}

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of oscillation. The general solution
to this equation is:

\begin{equation}
    x(t) = A\cos(\omega t + \phi)
\end{equation}

where $A$ is the amplitude and $\phi$ is the phase constant
\citep{goldstein2002}.
