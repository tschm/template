The template supports the fast creation of repositories of LaTeX documents.
Out of the box you get

* curated pre-commit-hooks (e.g. for spelling)
* github ci/cd workflows
* Makefile

With every push into the repo the document is compiled
and published on a draft branch.

## Development Commands

```bash
make fmt     # Install pre-commit hooks and run them on all files
```
